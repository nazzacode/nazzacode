# Does XR Need a New Keyboard? 
<!-- ALT: Does XR computing needs a new keyboard? -->

<!-- KEY TERMS? -->

*The year is 2027. You just got a new XR headset to replace your computer. Unlimited screen real estate in a distraction free realm. Or so you thought.* 
<!-- What more could you possibly want? -->
<!-- Exciting times! Praiseth be to Zuck. -->

Empowered by this expansive new computing paradigm, you stand up, ~~effortlessly able to continue your efforts~~.

!!! failure "Problem"

    Your keyboard is stuck on the desk.

How restraining.

<!-- XR promises a wider landscape of computing environments:  -->
XR means the freedom to take immersive computing anywhere: pace the room, roam out into nature, lie in bed or the comfiest of chairs; your cinematic information interface comes effortlessly with you.

XR "unlocks the map" for larger computer interfaces-- but here's the catch, as soon as you need a keyboard, you're tied to the desk (alternatively you may suffer the following torment).

Next time you see a futuristic render of someone orchestrating a elaborately complex XR interface with their mere hands, ask yourself this:
when you use a computer, could you last a day, let alone an hour, working like this? or would you want a keyboard?

</figure>

Though there are many cases where a touchscreen interface will do, for professional or otherwise performant computer use cases; such as writing documents, emails, or using specialist applications, keyboard presence is completely ubiquitous.
As XR grows to serve these use cases, it shall be strange that a floating 8k monitor comes everywhere with you, when a keyboard, a seemingly simpler device, can't.

## Solution: XR needs a new keyboard
XR is calling out for a new keyboard --or keyboard like device-- that matches the working range of the headset it will accompany. 
This problem is obvious for anyone that *actually tries* to use a XR headset as a computer. 

Take [SimulaVR](https://simulavr.com), a company building the first VR linux workstation. They have ran into this problem in practice and implemented the first a improvised solution, the 'Keyboard Apron'.
 
<figure markdown>
  ![SimulaVR](../images/simula_apron.jpeg){width=700}
  <figcaption> SimulaVR demonstration. From left: sitting away from desk (keyboard not ideal), lying in bed (keyboard not practical), standing (keyboard not possible; hence apron innovation). <a href="https://twitter.com/georgewsinger/status/1507840684556009478?cxt=HHwWjIC-zaPH9uwpAAAA">[source]</a> </figcaption>
</figure>

The Apron is an significant upgrade on the stationary, desk mounted keyboard, but not without flaws.
The arms are locked in a single (non-optimal) position, so cannot be combined with standard VR-controllers or gestures, not to mention, the setup is large and clunky.
It's a good hacky compromise, but not yet a truly native XR keyboard.

Elsewhere, the internet reveals a graveyard of past attempts at wearable keyboard tech, none of which quite made the cut as a mainstream keyboard replacement.
There was the 1992-2015 [twiddler](https://twiddler.tekgear.com), a chorded one-handed keyboard (still available today),
the 2005 [AlphaGrip](http://www.alphagrips.com), a gamecontroller-with-lots-of-extra-buttons shaped keyboard,
the 2015-present [Tap Strap](https://www.tapwithus.com), a web of rings that registers taps on a surface,
and the 2019 [CTRL-Labs writstband](https://www.curtisbarbre.com/ctrl-kit) (acquired by Meta/Facebook), which aimed to reconstruct gestures from electrical sensors on the wrist.

Having gone to great lengths to acquire and test them all, one shared weakness is certainly uncomfortable ergonomics and bad (or nonexistent) tactile feedback. 
Another common weakness is the keymaps: all are non-standard, so have a steep learning curve (weeks if not months of painstaking training), and all result in a considerably lower WPM than a standard keyboard; a bitter pill for all, and dealbreaker for many if not most.

This gives some direction to what a viable wearable keyboard might look like: comfortable ergonomics & tactile feedback, with a low learning curve (close to standard layout) & fast WPM.

<!-- It is why previous solutions have failed to feel inspiring   -->
<!-- engineering complexity of the task at hand. in particular hand ergonomics with lots of buttons... -->
<!-- a better solutions might now be available due to consumer 3D printing (better fit ergonomics) and the rise of XR (impetus) -->


<!-- None are entirely satisfactory. -->

<!-- !!! question -->

<!--     Why haven't the big tech companies developing XR technology been working on wearable keyboard input. -->

<!-- How does this problem get resolved? -->
<!-- We see three possibilities, either:  -->

<!-- 1. (It doesn't) Keyboard usage restrains XR mobility indefinitely.  -->
<!-- 3. XR evolves into a keyboardless computing environment. -->
<!-- 2. We get a new, XR friendly, portable/wearable keyboard. -->

<!-- (1) [as laid out](#problem-stationary-keyboards-restrict-xr) is unstable, people will natrually want (3). -->

<!-- (2) is patently naive, a need for what the keyboard provides: fast text and symbolic input, cannot be made be redundant in the XR computing platform, certainly not in the foreseeable future.  -->
<!-- People will continue to want to edit documents, emails, spreadsheets, code and use keyboard shortcuts-- task which are clunky using alternatives such as touchscreens or voice assistants.  -->
  
<!-- (3) is ideal, solving the problem. -->

<!-- Interestingly, leading XR platforms do not seem to be urgently pursuing (3). -->

<!-- ## Features of a good XR keyboard -->
<!-- Lets distil a practical checklist of features for a XR-suitable keyboard from our findings: -->

<!-- 1. *Wearable* :: Having a working range comparable to the headset it accompanies. -->

<!-- 2. *Fast enough* :: Input should be as fast/effective as a standard keyboard (or users will be torn). -->

<!-- 3. *Available soon (1-2 years)* :: XR headsets are already arriving. -->

<!-- 4. *Familiar keymap (QWERTY)* :: Not offering a familiar keymap would be very limiting. Many previous pioneering keymaps have failed to catch on.  -->

<!-- 4. *Ergonomic* : Should feel natural to use and not cause strain/RSI. -->


<!-- ## What is currently available -->
<!-- Lets research what existing solutions there are and how they match up to our criteria. -->

<!-- ## Why is no one building this? -->

<!-- Lazily assuming (1) will be enough or that (2) is possible. -->
<!-- instead of developing new technology -->

<!-- - Meta is highly influential -->
<!-- - iPadification Fallacy -->
<!-- - lazy option, new hardware/devoces is hard -->

<!-- Meta, currently the biggest player in this space, is marketing XR foremostly as a social-interactive entertainment metaverse, generally devoid of 1st class desktop functionality (and hence keyboard input)-- and many others are following suit. -->


<!-- Some rudimentary attempts have been made (SimulaVR keyboard aperon) ...  -->

<!-- - lazy solutions -->
<!-- - undervalue the keyboard -->
<!-- - don't really believe it will replace the desktop  -->
<!-- - lack of foresight? -->

<!-- have tended to underestimate the value proposition of (2), lazily assuming the suboptimal solutions (1) and/or (3). -->

<!-- This is one face of the broader iPadification fallacy, responsible for the in-vogue attempt to build XR computers devoid of serious symbolic input, instead with only mobile-esque pointing devices. -->

<!-- - ... the in-vogue (narrower) outlook of XR as a social-interactive entertainment metaverse of 3D virtual objects -->

<!-- What is crazy is that despite this, (2) seems currently be the assumed logic of XR computing platforms under development  -->

<!-- text and symbolic input/manipulation is core to human communication with computers.  -->

<!-- It is however worth noting because it currently seems to be the assumed logic of existing XR technologies.  -->



## Conclusion
We conclude that,
(1) the standard keyboard is not suitable for XR (moving, getting comfy, going outside) due to its lack of mobility,
(2) it is a convenient fiction that computers will be entirely, or even largely, operable without keyboards in the near future,
(3) hence, XR computers are hamstrung by the lack of a viable keyboard, 
and so finally, (4) yes, XR needs a new keyboard-- wearable computers need wearable input.

What exact form this will take is not yet clear, say for example, how much will such a device resemble the current keyboard?
What I do know is that I want an XR computer and so I want this.
If no one else is going to build this, I might just do it myself.

<!-- Reach out to join the movement.  -->

<!-- So whilst billion in investment pours into XR computing.  -->

<!-- a major XR workflow: moving, getting comfy, going outside, etc. is -->

<!-- conclusion -->

<!-- for XR to really be used as a computer, it will need a wearable new keyboard.    -->

<!-- The keyboard is a relic of the desktop computing paradigm, it is stationary only because the desktop was itself so. -->

<!-- The computer desk will not perish, but balance will be returned to the force. -->

<!-- ## Bonus: why nobody is building this -->
<!-- MAYBE: stupid quote form qualcomm guy -->
<!-- For the size of investment going into VR, I find it amazing how little attention there is on this issue -->
