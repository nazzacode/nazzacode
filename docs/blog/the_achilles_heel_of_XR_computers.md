# [DRAFT] Does XR need a new keyboard?
<!-- # [DRAFT] The Achilles Heel of XR Computers -->
<!-- ALT: XR needs a [native|different] keybaord -->

*The year is 2024. You just got a new VR/AR headset to replace your computer: unlimited screen real estate in a distraction free realm.
Exciting times! Praise be to Zuck.*

Empowered in this new computing paradigm, you go for a stroll outside, ~~effortlessly able to continue your work~~.
<!-- free from the bondage of the desk, -->

!!! failure "Problem"

    Your keyboard is stuck on the desk.

How restraining.


<!-- ## ? The promise of XR -->


## Problem: keyboards restrict XR

<!-- MAYBE DIAGRAM: XR in nature -->

XR unlocks an expanded landscape of computing: pace the room, roam out into nature, lie in bed or the comfiest of chairs-- all effortlessly bringing your infinite interface with you.
But if you want a keyboard, you're tied you to the desk.
<!-- You can use VR/AR headset almost anywhere you go, -->

</figure>

A keyboard is not always needed; there being many applications where a point-and-click interface will do.
Howvever, among productivity/professional computer use cases, the keyboard is ubiquitous.
So, if XR grows to serve these use cases, then the keyboard becomes this sole bottleneck sequestering you from the 'eXtended' world.
When your monitor comes everywhere with you, it will be strange that your keyboard, a seemingly simpler device, can't.

    </figure>

    Contary to the fear that VR will take us away from the real world, a major hope of XR computing is that it will return us to the locomotion lifestyle of our hunter-gatherer heritance: increasing time spent outdoors and moving our body in natural ways.
    As long as the stationary keyboard persists, we remain tied to the desk and this freedom cannot be fully realised.


## The harms of the computer desk
Contrasting XR's promise of liberating movement, there are significant harms of spending too much time at the computer desk-- a condition we'll refer to as *homo deskalldayos* (short: *homo deskos*).
One study showed that sitting for as little as 3 hours a day reduced average life expectancy by 2 years (CITE), and the computer desk is associated with characteristic posture and mobility deterioration such as
Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), which occurs when tendon tissue slowly degenerates as a result of constant stress or strain.

<!-- </figure> -->

<figure markdown>
  ![](../images/collage1.png){width=550}
  <figcaption> Posture and mobility deterioration associated with the computer desk </figcaption>
</figure>

This applies to roughly half of all adults in developed countries (the 'professional workforce'), who are accustomed to spending many hours a day stationed at a computer and discount the adverse health effects as normal working conditions.

??? note "A shallow solution"

    As a coping mechanism, homo deskos worship an icon deity known as *homo deskos uprightos*, an idealised form of desk posture that is genreally unattainble for extended periods of time, and less repairing that sometimes claimed. 

    <figure markdown>

      <figcaption> From left: homo deskos uprightos, homo neckacheos, homo 
      shouderstrainos, homo tightlowerbackos </figcaption>
    </figure>


Given a free life, no human would choose to sit upright all day, arms extended like a meerkat, waiting eagerly to develop cholesterol and RSI.
Like the plight of coal miners, this hazard will become more widely recognised in hindsight. 
Currently it serves an economic necessity: but soon we will push though the technological limitations of the stationary desk.


# The benefits of movement ?
Most of us don't need science to know that moving around, particularly outside is good for us, we are natrually drawn to it as a means of .....

Even so, scientific findings can show supprising effects

...

1. Physical 

2. Cognitive
    - you natrually intuit this
    - mental health
    - creativity

## Solution: XR needs a new keyboard
<!-- It might seem obvious that this XR needs a new keyboard,   -->

<!-- MAYBE: stupid quote form qualcomm guy -->

<!-- For the size of investment going into VR, I find it amazing how little attention there is on this issue -->

So it might be good if there was a keyboard that 

<!-- dont like this v -->
How does this problem get resolved?
We see three possibilities, either: 

1. (It doesn't) Keyboard usage restrains XR mobility indefinitely. 
3. XR evolves into a keyboardless computing environment.
2. We get a new, XR friendly, portable/wearable keyboard.

(1) [as laid out](#problem-stationary-keyboards-restrict-xr) is unstable, people will natrually want (3).

(2) is patently naive, a need for what the keyboard provides: fast text and symbolic input, cannot be made be redundant in the XR computing platform, certainly not in the foreseeable future. 
People will continue to want to edit documents, emails, spreadsheets, code and use keyboard shortcuts-- task which are clunky using alternatives such as touchscreens or voice assistants. 
  
(3) is ideal, solving the problem.

<!-- MOVE: up -->
Interestingly, leading XR platforms do not seem to be urgently pursuing (3).
Meta, currently the biggest player in this space, is marketing XR foremostly as a social-interactive entertainment metaverse, generally devoid of 1st class desktop functionality (and hence keyboard input)-- and many others are following suit.

## Features of a good XR keyboard
Lets distil a practical checklist of features for a XR-suitable keyboard from our findings:

1. *Wearable* :: Having a working range comparable to the headset it accompanies.

2. *Fast enough* :: Input should be as fast/effective as a standard keyboard (or users will be torn).

3. *Available soon (1-2 years)* :: XR headsets are already arriving.

4. *Familiar keymap (QWERTY)* :: Not offering a familiar keymap would be very limiting. Many previous pioneering keymaps have failed to catch on. 

4. *Ergonomic* : Should feel natural to use and not cause strain/RSI.


## What is currently available
Lets research what existing solutions there are and how they match up to our criteria.

| Keyboard Apron        | ![](../images/keyboard_apron2.jpg) | Simple hack in the right direction using split ergonomic keyboard. However movement is still limited and must switch between this and handheld controllers.                |

<!-- ## Why is no one building this? -->

<!-- Lazily assuming (1) will be enough or that (2) is possible. -->
<!-- instead of developing new technology -->

<!-- - Meta is highly influential -->
<!-- - iPadification Fallacy -->
<!-- - lazy option, new hardware/devoces is hard -->


Some rudimentary attempts have been made (SimulaVR keyboard aperon) ... 

<!-- - lazy solutions -->
<!-- - undervalue the keyboard -->
<!-- - don't really believe it will replace the desktop  -->
<!-- - lack of foresight? -->

<!-- have tended to underestimate the value proposition of (2), lazily assuming the suboptimal solutions (1) and/or (3). -->

<!-- This is one face of the broader iPadification fallacy, responsible for the in-vogue attempt to build XR computers devoid of serious symbolic input, instead with only mobile-esque pointing devices. -->

<!-- - ... the in-vogue (narrower) outlook of XR as a social-interactive entertainment metaverse of 3D virtual objects -->

<!-- What is crazy is that despite this, (2) seems currently be the assumed logic of XR computing platforms under development  -->

<!-- text and symbolic input/manipulation is core to human communication with computers.  -->

<!-- It is however worth noting because it currently seems to be the assumed logic of existing XR technologies.  -->





## Conclusion
XR needs a portable new keyboard.
What form this will takes is not clear, particularly how much such a device will resemble the current keyboard.
<!-- If you're not careful, I might just build one.  -->

The keyboard is a relic of the desktop computing paradigm, it is stationary only because the desktop was itself so.

In XR, a major workflow (moving, comfy and outside) is restricted

The computer desk will not perish, but balance will be returned to the force.
