# About

![Me](images/me2.jpg){ align=left width=275 }

Hi, I'm Nathan (`@nazzacode`) Sharp, an **aspiring transhuman wizard** from the UK. 
I also like to code, build things and write about fun topics like the future of computing. 

<!-- TODO: word cloud -->
I have a keen interest in Brain-Computer Interfaces, intelligence, personal knowledge management, memetics, futurism and street food.
<!-- Brain-Computer Interfaces, intelligence, futurism, the future of computing, street food, hip-hop, design engineering, aesthetics, books, information theory, knowledge graphs and representations, tools for thought, meditation, metaverse, and functional programming. -->

Right now I'm working to build XR computers, starting with input devices. 

<!-- I would describe my worldview as: retrograde, techno-utopian and mildly revolutionary -->
