This problem is obvious for anyone that actually tries to use a XR headset as a computer. </p> <p>Take SimulaVR, a company building the first VR linux workstation. They have ran into this problem in practice and implemented the first a improvised solution, the 'Keyboard Apron'.</p> <p> </p>  SimulaVR demonstration. From left: sitting away from desk (keyboard not ideal), lying in bed (keyboard not practical), standing (keyboard not possible; hence apron innovation). [source] <p>The Apron is an significant upgrade on the stationary, desk mounted keyboard, but not without flaws. The arms are locked in a single (non-optimal) position, so cannot be combined with standard VR-controllers or gestures, not to mention, the setup is large and clunky. It's a good hacky compromise, but not yet a truly native XR keyboard.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the internet reveals a graveyard of past attempts at wearable keyboard tech, none of which quite made the cut as a mainstream keyboard replacement. There was the 1992-2015 twiddler, a chorded one-handed keyboard (still available today), the 2005 AlphaGrip, a gamecontroller-with-lots-of-extra-buttons shaped keyboard, the 2015-present Tap Strap, a web of rings that registers taps on a surface, and the 2019 CTRL-Labs writstband (acquired by Meta/Facebook), which aimed to reconstruct gestures from electrical sensors on the wrist.</p> <p> </p>  The wearable keyboard graveyard. Clockwise from top left: Twiddler3, AlphaGrip, CRTL-Labs wristband, Tap Strap.  <p>Having gone to great lengths to acquire and test them all, one shared weakness is certainly uncomfortable ergonomics and bad (or nonexistent) tactile feedback.

This group includes the worlds 1+ billion professional workforce (roughly half of all adults in developed countries), and caries serious, often overlooked, health risks.</p> <p> </p>  Posture and mobility deterioration associated with the computer desk  <p>Homo deskos commonly suffers characteristic posture and mobility deterioration. The human body is designed for regular movement and so prolonged sitting leads to poor posture as it overburdens the static load on the musculoskeletal system; particularly straining the neck, back and spine-- causing pain. Moreover, the craned-neck posture and unnatural hand positioning/movement encouraged by computer use worsens this situation further. Neck, shoulder, back, elbow, wrist and finger damage are all endemic amongst computer users. Particularly common is Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), which occurs when tendon tissue slowly degenerates as a result of constant stress or strain. As many as 60% of computer-using professionals are expected to suffer debilitating RSI at some point their career (CITE).</p> <p>Prolonged sitting also prevents effective circulation of blood throughout the body. This is one reason people with high levels of sedentary time have been found to have a 112% increased risk of diabetes, 147% increased risk of cardiovascular death, and 49% increased risk of all-cause mortality. Not coincidentally, sitting is linked to increased blood pressure, increased body fat, increased cholesterol and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) (blood clots).  One study suggested that sitting for as little as 3 hours a day reduced average life expectancy by 2 years (CITE).</p> <p>Sedentary lifestyles also effect balance of mind and cognition, with sitting being linked to higher rates of depression, anxiety and even dementia (CITE).  Continuous sitting is also know to have an impact on energy levels and creative thinking.</p> A shallow solution <p>As a coping mechanism, homo deskos worship an icon deity known as homo deskos uprightos, an idealised form of desk posture that is genreally unattainble for extended periods of time, and less repairing that sometimes claimed. </p> <p>  From left: homo deskos uprightos, homo neckachei, homo    shouderstrainos and homo tightlowerbackeniki  </p> <p>Given a free life, no human would choose to sit upright all day, arms extended like a meerkat, waiting eagerly to develop diabetes and RSI.
